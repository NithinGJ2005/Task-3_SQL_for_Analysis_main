📌 Objective
To use SQL queries to extract and analyze structured data from a database using SQLite.

🛠 Tools Used
SQLite
Python (sqlite3 module)
VS Code
📂 Project Structure
Task-3-SQL/ │ ├── ecommerce_queries.sql # All SQL queries ├── run_sqlite.py # Python script to execute SQL ├── ecommerce.db # SQLite database file └── screenshots/ # Output screenshots

🧱 Database Design
Tables Created
customers
products
orders
Relationships
orders.customer_id → references customers.customer_id
orders.product_id → references products.product_id
🧾 SQL Concepts Implemented
✔ SELECT
✔ WHERE
✔ ORDER BY
✔ GROUP BY
✔ Aggregate Functions (SUM)
✔ INNER JOIN
✔ Subquery
✔ CREATE VIEW
✔ CREATE INDEX

🔍 Queries Performed
1️⃣ SELECT with WHERE
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE country = 'India';

2️⃣ ORDER BY
SELECT * FROM products
ORDER BY price DESC;

3️⃣ GROUP BY with SUM
SELECT customer_id, SUM(total_amount) AS total_spent
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id;

4️⃣ INNER JOIN
SELECT c.customer_name, o.total_amount
FROM customers c
INNER JOIN orders o
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;

5️⃣ Subquery
SELECT customer_name
FROM customers
WHERE customer_id IN (
    SELECT customer_id
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY customer_id
    HAVING SUM(total_amount) > 30000
);

6️⃣ View Creation
CREATE VIEW high_value_customers AS
SELECT customer_id, SUM(total_amount) AS total_spent
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING total_spent > 30000;

7️⃣ Index Creation
CREATE INDEX idx_customer_id
ON orders(customer_id);
📊 Output: Screenshots of executed queries and results

🎯 Outcome: Successfully created a relational database using SQLite, Executed multiple SQL queries for data analysis, Demonstrated understanding of joins, aggregation, subqueries, views, and indexing.
